Guiga Paint

This is a small painting project i Did with a guide obviously. It was pretty important to me because I had contact with a little bit of mouse events other than the regular ones like "click"
this project also introduced to me the canvas element and how it works in JS
also learned the concept of context on a project like that, using the getContext(2d)
hope you guys enjoy it, send me the drawings lol
if you have any idea on how to make the brush smoother so it won't draw a lot of dots when you move the mouse too fast instead of a line i'd appreciate it.
